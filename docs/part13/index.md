## Further reading after the courses

In this page will be published further reading and topics about C#. This page is only meant to teach the basics of programming and C#, but there is quite a lot more to be known.

### Some topics

* Graphical interfaces
  * Windows Presentation Foundation, WPF
  * Xamarin
  * Avalon
* Web development with C#
  * ASP.NET
* Visual Studio
  * IDE for creating everything in C#, rather than having to do it all manually

This list will grow, and might later contain details where to find information.
