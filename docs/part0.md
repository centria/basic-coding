## Part 0 - Learning goals and grading

The list below does not include everything, but exists to give a guideline for students, what to expect each week. This list may extend as the course goes on.

| Part     |      Goal   |  
|:--------:|:------------|
| 1| You can write simple programs, which read user input and for example basic calculations. You know the terms **variable**, **conditional** or **if**, and **while-loop** and can use them in the programs. |
| 2| You know the logical operators, such as **and**, **or** and **not** and can use them in conditionals and while-loops. You know what **methods**, **method parameters** and **method return** mean, how to create them and what happens in the program while a method is used. |
| 3| You can comment your code and understand how naming variables affects the readibility of code. You understand the basics of **lists** and can use them in your programs, and iterate through a list. |
| 4| You comprehend the terms **file** and **filesystem** and can read a simple file with your program. You know the basics for **Object oriented programming** and how to use this information in your programs. |
| 5| You know the different **data types** and how they differ from each other. You can **overload** methods and **constructors**. You can use all these in your programs. |
| 6| You understand the dfference between **static** and **non-static** classes and methods. You can separate **user interface** from program logic. |


| Part     |      Goal   |  
|:--------:|:------------|
| 7| You can create a project with proper structure and are able to run tests in the correct folder. |
| 8| You can use **dictionaries** as data storage, understand **hash** and solve problems with them in object oriented programming. |
| 9| You understand inheritance and interfaces. You will learn to create classes that inherit another classes, and also classes that implement one or more interfaces. |
| 10| You understand how objects are compared and can use this information. You understand the basics of enumeration and regular expressions. |
| 11| You can create random strings and numbers. You are able to handle exceptions, read and write (to and from) files, and use these in problem solving. |
| 12| You understand the basics of the keyword **using**. You can create small graphical interfaces for your programs. |



The courses are graded on a scale of 0-5, individually. The grade comprises of the amount of exercises done.

| Percentage done | Grade |
|:----------------|:-----:|
| 90 % or more    |   5   |
| 80 % - 89,99 %  |   4   |
| 70 % - 79,99 %  |   3   |
| 60 % - 69,99 %  |   2   |
| 50 % - 59,99 %  |   1   |
| Less than 50 %  |   0   |

At the end of the courses, there is also an exam with **pass / fail** grading. This does not affect the grade but is to ensure that you have done the exercises yourself. More information about the exam will come closer to the exam.
