| 2| You know the logical operators, such as `and`, `or` and `not` and can use them in conditionals and while-loops. You know what `methods`, `method parameters` and `method return` mean, how to create them and what happens in the program while a method is used. |
| 3| You can comment your code and understand how naming variables affects the readibility of code. You understand the basics of `arrays` and can use them in your programs, and iterate through an array. |
| 4| You comprehend the terms `file` and `filesystem` and can read a simple file with your program. You know the basics for `Object oriented programming` and how to use this information in your programs. |
| 5| You know the different `data types` and how they differ from each other. You can `overload` methods and `constructors`. You can use all these in your programs. |
