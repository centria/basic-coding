## Part 0 - Learning goals and grading

The list below does not include everything, but exists to give a guideline for students, what to expect each week. This list may extend as the course goes on.

| Part     |      Goal   |  
|----------|-------------|
| 1| You can write simple programs, which read user input and for example basic calculations. You know the terms `variable`, `conditional` or `if`, and `while-loop` and can use them in the programs. |
| 2| You know the logical operators, such as `and`, `or` and `not` and can use them in conditionals and while-loops. You know what `methods`, `method parameters` and `method return` mean, how to create them and what happens in the program while a method is used. |
| 3| You can comment your code and understand how naming variables affects the readibility of code. You understand the basics of `arrays` and can use them in your programs, and iterate through an array. |
| 4| You comprehend the terms `file` and `filesystem` and can read a simple file with your program. You know the basics for `Object oriented programming` and how to use this information in your programs. |
| 5| You know the different `data types` and how they differ from each other. You can `overload` methods and `constructors`. You can use all these in your programs. |
| 6| You understand the dfference between `static` and `non-static` classes and methods. You know the keyword `using` and how to use it in your program properly. |
  
The course is graded on a scale of 0-5. The grade comprises of the amount of exercises done.

| Percentage done | Grade |
|-----------------|-------|
| 90 % or more    |   5   |
| 80 % - 89,99 %  |   4   |
| 70 % - 79,99 %  |   3   |
| 60 % - 69,99 %  |   2   |
| 50 % - 59,99 %  |   1   |
| Less than 50 %  |   0   |

At the end of the course, there is also an exam with `pass / fail ` grading. This does not affect the grade but is to ensure that you have done the exercises yourself. More information about the exam will come closer to the exam.
