## Part 2 - Problem solving

The second part of the material focuses on repetition in programs and on how to divide funcionality into distinct units. 

In this part you will learn to  recognize that certain sub-problems, such as reading input or calculations, recur in programs. You will be aware of solution models to certain sub-problems. In the exercises, you practice combining solution patterns used on sub-problems to solve broader ones.
