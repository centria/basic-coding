# Lists

In programming, we often encounter situations where we want to handle many values. The only method we've used so far has been to define a separate variable for storing each value. This is impractical.

```cs
string word1;
string word2;
string word3;
// ...
string word10;
```

The solution presented above is useless in effect -- consider a situation in which there are thousands of words to store.

Programming languages offer tools to assist in storing a large quantity of values. We will next take a peek at the List, which is used for storing many values that are of the same type.

List is a pre-made tool in C# that helps dealing with lists. It offers various methods, including ones for adding values to the list, removing values from it, and also for the retrieval of a value from a specific place in the list. The concrete implementations -- i.e., how the list is actually programmed -- has beed abstracted behind the methods, so that a programmer making use of a list doesn't need to concern themselves with its inner workings.

## Using and Creating Lists


For a List to be used, it first needs be imported into the program. This is achieved by including the command **using System.Collections.Generic;** at the top of the program. Below is an example program where an List is imported into the program.

To use a List, it also has to be initialized. Below is an example where we create a List that holds integers, called **numbers**.

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Program 
{
    public static void Main(string[] args) 
    {
      List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
      // Rest of the code...
    }
}

```

Creating a new list is done with the command List\<type\> list = new List\<type\>(), where type is the type of the values to be stored in the list (e.g. int). We create a list for storing strings in the example below.

```cs
List<string> strings = new List<string>();
```

The type of the List variable is **List**. When a list variable is initialized, the type of the values to be stored is also defined in addition to the variable type -- all the variables stored in a given list are of the same type. As such, the type of an List that stores strings is **List\<string\>**. A new list is created with the command new List<>();.

## Defining the Type of Values That a List Can Contain

When defining the type of values that a list can include, the type is written the same way as when declaring variables. A list that includes int-type variables has to be defined in the form **List\<int\>**; and a list that includes double-type variables is defined in the form **List\<double\>**.

You'll find examples below of creating lists that contain different types of values.

```cs
List<int> list = new List<int>();
list.Add(1);
```

```cs
List<double> list = new List<double>();
list.Add(4.2);
```

```cs
List<bool> list = new List<bool>();
list.Add(true);
```

```cs
List<string> list = new List<string>();
lista.Add("String is text");
```

Once a list has been created, List assumes that all the variables contained in it are of the correct type. Of course, you can store variables with the correct type in them, as well. Then the value of said variable is stored.

```cs
List<int> integers = new List<int>();
int integer = 1;
integers.Add(integer);

List<double> doubles = new List<double>();
double d = 4.2;
doubles.Add(d);
```

## Adding to a List and Retrieving a Value from a Specific Place

The next example demonstrates the addition of a few strings into an List containing strings. Addition is done with the list method **Add**, which takes the value to be added as a parameter. We then print the value at position zero. To retrieve a value from a certain position, you use a special annotation of **list[index]**, where list is your list, and index is the position from where to get the data. 

```cs
public class WordListExample 
{
  public static void Main(string[] args) 
  {
    // create the word list for storing strings
    List<string> wordList = new List<string>();

    // add two values to the word list
    wordList.Add("First");
    wordList.Add("Second");

    // retrieve the value from position 0 of the word list, and print it
    Console.WriteLine(wordList[0]);
  }
}
```

Program writes:

```console
First
```

As can be seen, the latter method retrieves the first value from the list when it is given the parameter **0**. This is because list positions are counted starting from zero. The first value is found by wordList[0], the second by wordList[1], and so on.

```cs
public class WordListExample 
{
  public static void Main(string[] args) 
  {
    // create the word list for storing strings
    List<string> wordList = new List<string>();

    // add two values to the word list
    wordList.Add("First");
    wordList.Add("Second");

    // retrieve the value from position 0 of the word list, and print it
    Console.WriteLine(wordList[1]);
  }
}
```

Program writes:

```console
Second
```

## Retrieving Information from a "Non-Existent" Place

If you try to retrieve information from a place that does not exist on the list, the program will print a **ArgumentOutOfRangeException** error. In the example below, two values are added to a list, after which there is an attempt to print the value at place two on the list.

```cs
public class WordListExample 
{
  public static void Main(string[] args) 
  {
    // create the word list for storing strings
    List<string> wordList = new List<string>();

    // add two values to the word list
    wordList.Add("First");
    wordList.Add("Second");

    // retrieve the value from position 0 of the word list, and print it
    Console.WriteLine(wordList[2]);
  }
}
```

Since the numbering (i.e., indexing) of the list elements starts with zero, the program isn't able to find anything at place two and its execution ends with an error. Below is a description of the error message caused by the program.

```console
Unhandled exception. System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection. (Parameter 'index')
   at System.Collections.Generic.List`1.get_Item(Int32 index)
   at WordListExample.Program.Main(String[] args) in ... Program.cs:line 13
```

The error message tells exactly what and where happened. First, the error contains the error type, **ArgumentOutOfRangeException**. Then it gives a possible correction. Next, the error contains which method caused the error. In this case, it would be the **get_Item(Int32 index)**. Last, the error tells us which part of our code triggered the error.

As you can see, when calling for List[index], we are actually calling method **System.Collections.Generic.List`1.get_Item(Int32 index)**, which is a more complex method, already built in. This is the advantage of built-in methods: We do not have to worry about how to implement a method for data retrieval from a list, as it already exists.

## Numbering and index

Numbering places, i.e., indexing, always begins with zero. The list's first value is located at index 0, the second value at index 1, the third value at index 2, and so on. In programs, an index is denoted with a variable called **i**.

Example list called numbers could contain something like this...

|i|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|...|
|-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|value|6|1|2| 4| 4| 3||

In the list above, the first value is 6 and the second value 1. If a new value was added to the list by calling the **Add method** of numbers with 8 as parameter, the number 8 would be placed at index 6. It would be the seventh number in the list.

```cs
numbers.Add(8);
```

|i|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|...|
|-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|value|6|1|2| 4| 4| 3|8|

Similarly, by calling the method **numbers[index]** with the parameter 4 the fifth number in the list would be retrieved.

Each tool offered by C# has a name and location. The program can use a tool after it has been imported with the **using** command. The command is given the location and the name of the desired class. For example, the use of a **Console** from System necessitates placing the command **using System;** to the top of the program.

```cs
using System;

public class Program 
{  
    public static void Main(string[] args) 
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Console has been imported");
    }  
}   
```

The same usually applies to all C# classes. **Console** is called directly from system, so we can import it with just **using System;**. If we want to use Lists, we have to go deeper, and use **using System.Collections.Generic;**.

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Program 
{  
    public static void Main(string[] args) 
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Console has been imported");
        List<string> list = new List<string>();
        list.Add("List can be now used, too.");
    }  
}   
```

## Iterating Over a List

We'll next be examining methods that can be used to go through the values on a list. Let's start with a simple example where we print a list containing four values.

```cs
List<string> teachers = new List<string>();

teachers.Add("Simon");
teachers.Add("Samuel");
teachers.Add("Ann");
teachers.Add("Anna");

Console.WriteLine(teachers[0]);
Console.WriteLine(teachers[1]);
Console.WriteLine(teachers[2]);
Console.WriteLine(teachers[3]);
```

```console
Simon
Samuel
Ann
Anna
```

The example is obviously clumsy. What if there were more values on the list? Or fewer? What if we didn't know the number of values on the list?

The number of values on a list is provided by the list's **Count** property which returns the number of elements the list contains. The number is an integer (int), and it can be used as a part of an expression or stored in an integer variable for later use.

```cs
List<string> list = new List<string>();
Console.WriteLine("Number of values on the list: " + list.Count);

lista.add("First");
Console.WriteLine("Number of values on the list: " + list.Count);

int values = list.Count;

lista.add("Second");
Console.WriteLine("Number of values on the list: " + values);
```

```console
Number of values on the list: 0 
Number of values on the list: 1 
Number of values on the list: 1
```

NOTICE! The **Count is not a method** but a property. This means that when calling Count, we do not add brackets in the end!

Let's make a new version of the program that prints each index manually. In this intermediate version we use the **index** variable to keep track of the place that is to be outputted.


```cs
List<string> teachers = new List<string>();

teachers.Add("Simon");
teachers.Add("Samuel");
teachers.Add("Ann");
teachers.Add("Anna");

int index = 0;

if (index < teachers.Count) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(teachers[index]); // index = 0
  index = index + 1; // index = 1
}

if (index < teachers.Count) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(teachers[index]); // index = 1
  index = index + 1; // index = 2
}

if (index < teachers.Count) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(teachers[index]); // index = 2
  index = index + 1; // index = 3
}

if (index < teachers.Count) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(teachers[index]); // index = 3
  index = index + 1; // index = 4
}

if (index < index.Count) 
{
  // this will not be executed since index = 4 and teachers.Count = 4
  Console.WriteLine(teachers[index]);
  index = index + 1;
}
```

We can see that there's repetition in the program above.

We can convert the if statements into a while loop that is repeated until the condition index < teachers.Count no longer holds (i.e., the value of the variable index grows too great).

```cs
List<string> teachers = new List<string>();

teachers.Add("Simon");
teachers.Add("Samuel");
teachers.Add("Ann");
teachers.Add("Anna");

int index = 0;
// Repeat for as long as the value of the variable `index`
// is smaller than the size of the teachers list
while (index < teachers.Count) 
{
  Console.WriteLine(teachers[index]);
  index = index + 1;
}
```

Now the printing works regardless of the number of elements.

The for-loop is extremely handy here. We can convert the loop above to a for-loop, after which the program looks like this.

```cs
List<string> teachers = new List<string>();

teachers.Add("Simon");
teachers.Add("Samuel");
teachers.Add("Ann");
teachers.Add("Anna");

for (int index = 0; index < teachers.Count; index++) 
{
    Console.WriteLine(teachers[index]);
}
```

```console
Simon
Samuel
Ann
Anna
```

The index variable of the for-loop is typically labelled **i**:

```cs
for (int i = 0; i < teachers.Count; i++) 
{
    Console.WriteLine(teachers[index]);
}
```

Let's consider using a list to store integers. The functionality is largely the same as in the previous example. The greatest difference has to do with the initialization of the list -- the type of value to be stored is defined as int, and the value to be printed is stored in a variable called number before printing.

```cs
List<int> numbers = new List<int>();

numbers.Add(1);
numbers.Add(2);
numbers.Add(3);
numbers.Add(4);

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Count; i++) 
{
    int number = numbers[i];
    Console.WriteLine(number);
    // alternatively: Console.WriteLine(numbers[i]);
}
```

```console
1
2
3
4
```

Printing the numbers in the list in reverse order would also be straightforward.

```cs
List<int> numbers = new List<int>();

numbers.Add(1);
numbers.Add(2);
numbers.Add(3);
numbers.Add(4);

int index = numbers.Count - 1;
while (index >= 0)
{
  int number = numbers[index];
  Console.WriteLine(number);
  index = index - 1;
}
```

```console
4
3
2
1
```

Try and recreate the previous example with the for loop!

## Iterating Over a List with a For-Each Loop

If you don't need to keep track of the index as you're going through a list's values, you can make use of the **for-each** loop. It differs from the previous loops in that it has no separate condition for repeating or incrementing.


```cs
List<string> teachers = new List<string>();

teachers.Add("Simon");
teachers.Add("Samuel");
teachers.Add("Ann");
teachers.Add("Anna");

foreach (string teacher in teachers)
{
  Console.WriteLine(teacher);
}
```

In practical terms, the for-each loop described above hides some parts of the for-loop we practiced earlier.The for-each loop would look like this if implemented as a for-loop:

```cs
List<string> teachers = new List<string>();

teachers.Add("Simon");
teachers.Add("Samuel");
teachers.Add("Ann");
teachers.Add("Anna");

for (int i = 0; i < teachers.Count; i++) 
{
    string teacher = teachers[i];
    Console.WriteLine(teacher);
}
```

In practice, the for-each loop examines the values of the list in order one at a time. The expression is defined in the following format: **for (typeOfVariable nameOfVariable: nameOfList)**, where **typeOfVariable** is the list's element type, and **nameOfVariable** is the variable that is used to store each value in the list as we go through it.

## Removing from a List and Checking the Existence of a Value

The list's **RemoveAt(index)** method removes the value that is located at the index that's given as the parameter. The parameter is an integer.

```cs
// create the list for storing strings
List<string> list = new List<string>();

// add three values to the list
list.Add("First");
list.Add("Second");
list.Add("Third");

// Remove from index 1
list.RemoveAt(1);

// retrieve the value from positions 0 and 1 of the list, and print them
Console.WriteLine(list[0]);
Console.WriteLine(list[1]);
```

```console
First
Third
```

We can also use the method **Remove** if we know the value of the item we want to remove:

```cs
// create the list for storing strings
List<string> list = new List<string>();

// add three values to the list
list.Add("First");
list.Add("Second");
list.Add("Third");

// Remove with value "Second"
list.Remove("Second");

// retrieve the value from positions 0 and 1 of the list, and print them
Console.WriteLine(list[0]);
Console.WriteLine(list[1]);
```

```console
First
Third
```

The methods work exactly the same way with integers, so be careful, which method you use!

```cs
// create the list for storing integers
List<int> list = new List<int>();

// add three values to the list
list.Add(1);
list.Add(3);
list.Add(2);

// Remove with value "Second"
list.RemoveAt(1);

// retrieve the value from positions 0 and 1 of the list, and print them
Console.WriteLine(list[0]);
Console.WriteLine(list[1]);
```

```console
1
2
```

```cs
// create the list for storing integers
List<int> list = new List<int>();

// add three values to the list
list.Add(1);
list.Add(3);
list.Add(2);

// Remove with value 
list.Remove(1);

// retrieve the value from positions 0 and 1 of the list, and print them
Console.WriteLine(list[0]);
Console.WriteLine(list[1]);
```

```console
3
2
```

NOTICE! The method **Remove** removes the first match it finds. So, if your list would contain multiples of the same value, only the first one would be removed!


The list method **Contains** can be used to check the existence of a value in the list. The method receives the value to be searched as its parameter, and it returns a boolean type value (True or False) that indicates whether or not that value is stored in the list.

```cs
// create the list for storing strings
List<string> list = new List<string>();

// add three values to the list
list.Add("First");
list.Add("Second");
list.Add("Third");

Console.WriteLine("Can we find First: " + list.Contains("First"));


if (list.Contains("Second"))
{
  Console.WriteLine("We found second!");
}
```

```console
Can we find First: True
We found second!
```

## List as a Method Parameter

Like other variables, a list, too, can be used as a parameter to a method. When the method is defined to take a list as a parameter, the type of the parameter is defined as the type of the list and the type of the values contained in that list. Below, the method **Print** prints the values in the list one by one.

```cs
public static void Print(List<String> list)
{
  foreach (string value in list)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(value);
  }
}
```

We're by now familiar with methods, and it works in the same way here. In the example below we use the method that was implemented above.

```cs
List<string> strings = new List<string>();

strings.Add("First");
strings.Add("Second");
strings.Add("Third");

Print(strings);
```

```console
First
Second
Third
```

The chosen parameter in the method definition is not dependent on the list that is passed as parameter in the method call. In the program that calls Print, the name of the list variable is **string**, but inside the method Print the variable is called **list** -- the name of the variable that stores the list could also be **printables**, for instance.

It's also possible to define multiple variables for a method. In the example the method receives two parameters: a list of numbers and a threshold value. It then prints all the numbers in the list that are smaller than the second parameter.

```cs
public static void PrintSmallerThan(List<int> numbers, int threshold) 
{
  foreach(int number in numbers)
  {
    if (number < threshold) 
    {
      Console.WriteLine(number);
    }
  }
}
```

Here we see it in action:

```cs
List<int> list = new List<int>();

list.Add(1);
list.Add(2);
list.Add(3);
list.Add(2);
list.Add(1);

PrintSmallerThan(list, 3);
```

```console
1
2
2
1
```

As before, a method can also return a value. The methods that return values have the type of the return value in place of the **void** keyword, and the actual returning of the value is done by the **return** command. The method below returns the Count of the list.

```cs
public static void Count(List<string> list)
{
  return list.Count;
}
```

You can also define own variables for methods. The method below calculates the average of the numbers in the list. If the list is empty, it returns the number -1.

```cs
public static double Average(List<int> numbers) 
{
  if (numbers.Count == 0) 
  {
      return -1.0;
  }

  int sum = 0;
  foreach(int number in numbers) 
  {
      sum = sum + number;
  }

  return 1.0 * sum / numbers.Count;
}
```
## On Copying the List to a Method Parameter

Earlier we have used integers, floating point numbers, etc. as method parameters. When variables such as int are used as method parameters, the value of the variable is copied for the method's use. The same occurs in the case that the parameter is a list.

Lists, among practically all the variables that can store large amounts of information, are reference-type variables. This means that the value of the variable is a reference that points to the location that contains the information.

When a list (or any reference-type variable) is copied for a method's use, the method receives the value of the list variable, i.e., a reference. In such a case the **method receives a reference to the real value of a reference-type variable**, and the method is able to modify the value of the original reference type variable, such as a list. In practice, the list that the method receives as a parameter is the same list that is used in the program that calls the method.

Let's look at this briefly with the following method.

```cs
public static void RemoveFirst(List<int> numbers)
{
if (numbers.Count == 0)
{
return;
}
numbers.RemoveAt(0);
}
```

```cs
List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
numbers.Add(3);
numbers.Add(2);
numbers.Add(6);
numbers.Add(-1);

Console.WriteLine("First print: ");
numbers.ForEach(Console.WriteLine);

RemoveFirst(numbers);

Console.WriteLine("Second print: ");
numbers.ForEach(Console.WriteLine);

RemoveFirst(numbers);
RemoveFirst(numbers);
RemoveFirst(numbers);

Console.WriteLine("Third print: ");
numbers.ForEach(Console.WriteLine);
```

```console
First print: 
3
2
6
-1
Second print: 
2
6
-1
Third print: 
```

As you can see, the methor **RemoveFirst** affects the list it was given as a parameter, directly.

NOTICE! Instead of doing **Console.WriteLine(numbers)**, to get the values from the list, the annotation is **numbers.ForEach(Console.WriteLine);** !!

## A Summary of List Methods and Properties

You can find all the information about [**Lists here**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=netframework-4.8). For the most part, we don't need all that information, but a hand selected part from it.

* Adding to a list is done with the method *Add** that receives the value to be added as a parameter.

```cs
List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
numbers.Add(3);
```

* The number of elements in a list can be discovered with the property **Count**; it returns an integer.

```cs
List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
int amount = numbers.Count;
Console.WriteLine("Amount of integers in numbers: " + amount);
```

* You can retrieve a value from a certain index with the method **list[index]** that is given the index at which the value resides as a parameter.

```cs
List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
numbers.Add(3);
Console.WriteLine(numbers[0]);
```

* Removing elements is done with either **Remove** or **RemoveAt**, depending if we remove by value or index.

```cs
List<string> list = new List<string>();
list.Add("First");
list.Add("Second");
list.Add("Third");
list.RemoveAt(0);
list.Remove("Third");
```

* Checking for the existence of a value is done with the method **Contains**. It's provided the value being searched for as a parameter, and it returns a boolean value.

```cs
List<string> list = new List<string>();
list.Add("First");
list.Contains("First");
```

* To iterate a list, we use forEach

```cs
List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
numbers.Add(3);
numbers.Add(2);

numbers.ForEach(Console.WriteLine);
```

**You can now do the exercises for lists**
