## Where to begin

Before you do this course, it is advised to do the [**course for command line and version control first**](https://centria.github.io/console/). This gives you tools to learn how to create your own Git repository and how to use it. This is required for returning the exercises for this course.

## Doing the exercises

[**The exercises for this course are behind this link**](https://github.com/centria/coding-exercises). Do read each material section before trying to do the exercises.

## Requirements

To do the exercises, you need [**Dotnet Core**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and a decent editor, such as [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as well as a [**GitHub account**](https://github.com/).

You can use any editor, but the instructions are written with VSC in mind.
